```bash
# Run all unit tests
cd prototype-app/backend
/usr/local/maven/bin/mvn test -Dtest=GithubAdvisory*

# Expected: All tests pass
# Coverage: GithubAdvisoryPlatformServiceTest, GithubAdvisoryTenantServiceTest
```

**What to Test:**
- [ ] Platform sync with incremental updates
- [ ] New advisory detection
- [ ] Withdrawn advisory handling
- [ ] Component-to-advisory correlation
- [ ] Version range matching
- [ ] Tenant isolation

### 5.2 Integration Testing
**Objective:** Verify end-to-end flows with real Postgres

```bash
# Run Postgres integration tests
/usr/local/maven/bin/mvn -Ppostgres-it verify

# Expected: Schema created, data flows correctly
```

**What to Test:**
- [ ] Migration runs successfully
- [ ] Tables created with proper indexes
- [ ] Platform GHSA cache populated
- [ ] Tenant opt-in toggle working
- [ ] Component correlation succeeds
- [ ] Findings created correctly
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation enforced

### 5.3 Frontend Component Testing
**Objective:** Verify React components work correctly

```bash
# Run frontend tests
cd prototype-app/frontend
npm test

# Expected: GithubAdvisoryStatus tests pass
```

**What to Test:**
- [ ] Component renders without errors
- [ ] Status display shows correct state
- [ ] Advisory list loads correctly
- [ ] Dark/light theme switching works
- [ ] Real-time updates via React Query
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully

### 5.4 Manual Integration Testing
**Objective:** Test actual end-to-end flow

```bash
# 1. Verify health checks
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
curl http://localhost:5173

# 2. Get GitHub token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxx..."

# 3. Trigger platform sync
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/platform/ghsa/sync/trigger \
  -H "X-API-Key: change-me-in-prod" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN"

# 4. Check sync status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/platform/ghsa/sync-status \
  -H "X-API-Key: change-me-in-prod"

# 5. Enable for tenant
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tenants/{tenant-id}/ghsa/enable \
  -H "X-API-Key: change-me-in-prod"

# 6. View advisories for source
curl http://localhost:8080/api/tenants/{tenant-id}/ghsa/component-advisories/{source-id} \
  -H "X-API-Key: change-me-in-prod"

# 7. Check in browser
# http://localhost:5173 → Look for GitHub Advisory Status panel
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Platform sync completes without errors
- ✅ 5k+ advisories cached
- ✅ Correlation completes successfully
- ✅ Findings appear in UI
- ✅ No data leaks between tenants

## Phase 7: Performance Baseline (Week 2-3)

### 7.1 Establish Metrics

```bash
# 1. Measure initial sync time
time curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/platform/ghsa/sync/trigger

# 2. Check database query performance
# In Postgres:
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements WHERE query LIKE '%github_security%';

# 3. Measure correlation time
# Add timing logs to GithubAdvisoryTenantService

# 4. Verify indexes
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE relname LIKE '%github%';
```

### 7.2 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Acceptable |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Initial platform sync | < 5 min | < 10 min |
| Incremental sync | < 30 sec | < 60 sec |
| Component correlation | < 100ms/comp | < 500ms/comp |
| API response time | < 1 sec | < 2 sec |
| Memory footprint | < 500MB cache | < 1GB cache |

### 7.3 Optimization (if needed)

**If slow:**
- [ ] Add database indexes
- [ ] Batch correlation processing
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Parallelize component matching
- [ ] Use pagination for large datasets

## Questions to Answer Before Production

1. **GitHub API:** Do we have production GitHub tokens configured?
2. **Database:** Is staging database backup strategy correct?
3. **Monitoring:** Are alerting thresholds appropriate?
4. **Communication:** Who needs to be notified of rollout?
5. **Support:** Are support teams trained on new feature?
