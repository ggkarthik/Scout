/**
 * Serialises ingestion per asset so two documents cannot mutate one asset's inventory at
 * once.
 *
 * <p>This used to be a {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock} in a map, which
 * guarded only the JVM holding it: with more than one instance running, concurrent uploads
 * for the same asset proceeded in parallel. It could also strand an asset permanently, since
 * a thread that died between {@code tryLock} and {@code unlock} left the entry locked for the
 * lifetime of the process, and every later attempt failed with "already in progress".
 *
 * <p>It is now a transaction-scoped Postgres advisory lock, which is visible across instances
 * and released by the database when the transaction ends, so it cannot be leaked. Every
 * ingestion entry point is {@code @Transactional}, so a transaction is always open here.
 *
 * <p>The key comes from {@link IngestionJobLockService} so that this path and the asynchronous
 * ingestion-job worker contend on the same key for the same asset. Previously one used a
 * JVM lock and the other a database lock, so they did not exclude each other at all. When the
 * worker calls in while already holding the key, the acquisition is re-entrant within the
 * session and succeeds.
