# Migration reset — 2026-09-04

The pre-customer migration history was consolidated into independent platform and tenant V1 baselines. The reset covers only local, demo, and staging databases containing test data.

Before deploying this revision, export each non-production database, stop workers, and drop the schemas and Flyway history tables together. Run the privileged schema bootstrap, verify tenant checksums/RLS/control-plane status, then reseed approved demo data and restart workers. Never delete Flyway history separately from its schema.

Routine migrations are append-only. Existing migration files must not be edited, renamed, or deleted. CI compares each pull request with its base branch and the required merge-queue run checks the combined catalog for duplicate versions.
